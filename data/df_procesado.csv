4,"AmazonBasics batteries are quite good in terms of capacity -- pretty much tied for the top spot compared to the other 6 brands I've tested, but other brands have the edge in capacity per dollar. When I computed value by dividing capacity by the cost per battery of the cheapest package size, they took a respectable third place, and they have the advantage of being a trusted name compared to the value leader. In the images I have attached a graph and a table summarizing my test results for the 7 types I've tested, but if you'd like to know more about how I test ... on to the in-dept test review.I've been on a bit of a quest to test all of the top-selling aaa batteries on Amazon in a repeatable, precise way. This means the same equipment, same environmental conditions, and same slots in the equipment will be used for each test. For each test, I fully discharge 3 batteries in my Opus BT-C2000 battery analyzer at rates of 100 ma, 200 ma, and 400 ma (discharge rate affects usable capacity). I have also performed this exact same test (same equipment, same conditions) on the ACDelco, Duracell Procell, Duracell Coppertop, Energizer MAX, Maxell, and Rayovac. I have linked the other brands I've reviewed at the end of this review if you'd like to take a look at the other results for comparison purposes. For the Amazon Basics batteries, the capacity at each discharge rate was:Disch Rt Capacity Runtime Sample use case100 mA 997 mAh 10 hrs Low-power LED flashlight200 mA 914 mAh 4.5 hrs Electronic toy / medium LED flashlight400 mA 623 mAh 1.5 hrs Motorized toy / bright LED flashlightNote that these (and all other Alkalines) would achieve somewhat higher capacity (maybe 1200 mAh) in a low discharge application like a mouse, keyboard, remote control, etc because alkaline batteries have internal resistance that reduces usable capacity at high discharge rates.The capacity of these batteries is among the best I've tested -- take a look at the attached data table for comparative data. For the cost (0.31/ea in a 36 pack right now), these are a decent but beatable value -- the power supplied per dollar spent is very good, but eclipsed by other currently available options.Comparison:These batteries do well capacity-wise, but value-wise are blown away by the currently cheapest energy/dollar battery that I've tested, the ACDelco aaa's. Their capacity results were:Disch Rt Capacity Runtime100 mA 1005 mAh 10 hrs200 mA 864 mAh 4.3 hrs400 mA 670 mAh 1.7 hrsAs you can see, the Amazon batteries were very comperable ... but, at the current time the AmazonBasics batteries are 0.31/ea (36 pack), while the ACDelco batteries are about 0.21/ea (48 pack) -- so the ACDelco are significantly cheaper per mAh. I did not test shelf life, so it's possible that these may hold up better sitting in a drawer. Although both the Amazon batteries and the ACDelco batteries are certainly made on contract by a third party, I do think that I trust Amazon a bit more to provide consistent batteries than ACDelco ... although I haven't had any trouble with my ACDelco batteries so far. It's also worth noting that the Amazon batteries come in clearly superior packaging - while the ACDelco batteries come in a horrible gigantic plastic blister pack, the Amazon batteries come in a closable cardboard box. If you don't go through a lot of batteries organization of your battery drawer is important to you, that could push them into the all-around winner category despite the 50 price premium.Finally, because another review specifically mentions the Rayovac AA's as being 'good' in some usage scenarios, I thought I'd share my findings for the Rayovac AAA's. In short, they're garbage - the Amazon batteries are better in EVERY case. It's possible that the Rayovac AA's are much better than the AAA's, but I think it's more likely that the version of the Rayovacs tested by the website that he got his results from is different than the most popular Rayovac on Amazon (I source all of my batteries from Amazon). I ran the Rayovac test several times because I couldn't believe how poorly they did ... here are some typical Rayovac results:Disch Rt Capacity Runtime100 mA 908 mAh 9 hrs200 mA 590 mAh 2.9 hrs400 mA 443 mAh 1.1 hrsMy other battery tests/reviews:I have posted reviews for Duracell Coppertop, Duracell Procell and ACDelco aaa alkaline batteries with capacity data gathered using the exact same method and equipment. To find those reviews for comparison purposes, go to the product pages linked below and search for 'mah' under 'all reviews' (or just browse to them on my profile).

He (or she, I can't remember) claimed these work as well or better than name brands and are even less expensive than the dollar store deals and with much less waste in the packaging.So I ordered some and his advice was right on the money. I've used them (so far) in small flashlights and in one of my TENS machines. Great performance. The price (which seems to fluctuate) is less than I was paying locally. Best of all, you get 36 batteries in a tiny cardboard box that measures 4 1/4 x 2 1/4 x 2 1/4. There are 9 sealed packages of 4 batteries each, but there's much less waste in the packaging.

5,"As a rule, it's hard to tell the difference between one alkaline battery and another.

The copper-top Duracells make it easy to avoid putting in new batteries upside down.On the other hand, the packaging excels. Instead of a brick of loose batteries, sets of 4 batteries are shrunk together, making it easier to avoid loosing loose batteries, without consuming the space that the big cards with their bubbles consume.

2,"So, I purchased a pack of these a month ago (11-Dec-2015) and was using them as expected, when I hit a snag. At LEAST 3 batteries from this pack were marginal/undervoltage (1.5V) out of the box. I found this out because I had replaced a pair of batteries in one of my remote sensors for my wall mounted indoor weather station because the had sensor stopped working. I thought maybe I had inserted them wrong, but no, the +/- marks matched the batteries. So I tried several times to reset both the sensor and the station with no luck. At one point, I had all of the batteries out to force a reset and put them back. But now my weather station would not power up either.That was the clue I needed. I got my trusty multimeter (with battery tester) and checked out all 5 of the Amazon Basics AA cells. Like all NEW 1.5V batteries, most of them showed 1.6V which is typical. Two of them were at 1.48V, which was just low enough for them to be considered undervoltage. No new AA battery should arrive with 1.5V. This is the first and only time I have ever seen fresh batteries arrive in a not as new condition with caused problems with my electronics.I generally like all of the various Amazon Basics products (mice, HDMI cables, etc.), but this has caused me to have doubts about not only their AA batteries, but all of the house branded products.

It it amazing how much cheaper these are- and you get twice as many. I got these in AA, AAA, C and D. The main reason I even bought them was when I was looking for flashlight batteries- size D for my trusty maglight (yes they are heavy but I love them for it, they are perfect for a car and the weight keeps it steady if you have to put it down) and size C for a different flashlight. Of course I needed an odd number and couldn't believe how expensive they were in the store. I checked Amazon- had no clue amazon had their own batteries and noticed that in all of the sizes- the price was less then the smallest pack of that size in the store and had twice as many batteries. Did I need this many AAA batteries at the time- nope but let me tell you I'm so glad I got extra- less than a week after buying them I had already nearly used every one. I went around the house and replaced every remote and device I could find and they work great!

When I lifted the plastic to get a battery, other batteries tumbled out and soon I had a mess in my battery drawer. However, Amazon's batteries are very special from the minute you receive it. They arrive in a small cardboard box that just fits in your hand and opens easily from the top for removal of a battery or two. They will never fall out of the box and make a mess. I have not had a problem with using the batteries like I did when purchasing a brand from a big box store that carried its name -- the batteries leaked inside my TV remote control and made a white stain on the top of my entertainment center. Since I use the remote every day, the batteries were not left alone long enough for this to happen but it did. I went around the apartment removing those batteries from every item I own and did not want to be ruined, cleaned the mess inside the remote and vowed never to purchase batteries from that store again -- not even the name brands they often sell -- my revenge on the store for causing a white mark on my furniture -- a petty but satisfying act that was my small way of paying back.

4,"The Amazon product line seems to have decent products. These batteries are no exception. There are many reviewers who will say these batteries are terrible, good, great, awesome, unsurpassed, etc. It seems the general consensus is these batteries are great for their intended purpose.First, I recommend you take a look at C (https://www.amazon.com/gp/pdp/profile/A35H8Y36S43CSG/refcmcrdppdp) review. This is a highly credible review as he put in his time and effort to test the batteries out. With that said, here are my two cents on batteries I have previously bought on Amazon:Rayovac: Smart choice for your portable digital electronics, lasting just a little less long as other leading brands. They are perfect for powering low-drain devices like clocks, radios, remote controls and low-powered flashlights. If you're looking for an affordable and reliable battery, get these. But it only works for me on 3-5 uses using my eyelash curler. These are good and cheap batteries. I use them for simple things that don't require a lot of power, such as my computer mouse. They do not last long, but for the price I pay I don't expect them to. if I want a quick battery that isn't going to cost more than a couple dollars I usually go with these.Duracell:Despite the shorter use by date (3/2021) than my recently purchased Energizer Industrial AAA alkalines (12/2026), these ProCell (Duracell) alkaline AAA cells have the highest open circuit voltage I've ever measured. I admit to being a price shopper, opting for 48 for 15 (Prime) rather than 24 for 11. If I get results similar to the ProCell AA and D cells I recently purchased, the AAA's should be good performers. Sadly, they are a too-tight fit to use in my recent Surefire Titan (flashlight) one AAA cell LED flashlight - but that is on the Surefire. I received decent life on these batteries besides using them in a flashlight (remote control car, remote, smoke alarm (7 months) and others. Good batteries for the right price.Energizer:I have used these in my mouse for my computer, my Xbox 360 Remote and my cable box remote. Part of me feels like these didn't last as long as they could have, but my mouse never gets shut off and my Xbox gets used relatively often (I'm not a gamer, but I use the system to watch movies).I read other reviews where people say that one of the sellers is selling used batteries I didn't have that experience. Mine arrived in a package that didn't seem to have been tampered with prior to shipping.I just ordered some Duracell Procell batteries. I want to see if they'll last longer than these did and they did not.Energizer Lithium:I put these batteries into all of the electronic Z-wave door locks that I own, because the Duracell alkaline batteries that I had been using were dying very quickly (they'd only last a about 2 months, and rechargeable ones would only last 3-4 weeks). The locks are very low-drain because most of the time they are just sitting there, but when you unlock or lock it uses a large burst of energy. And that's exactly the type of device that lithium batteries are recommended to be used in. I installed these about 4 months ago and they're all still showing 100 charge in my system control panel! Granted it only moves in 25 levels so it could be anywhere from 76-100, but still even if it depleted at a rate of 25 every 4 months that means they'll be good for at least 1 year before being replaced. That's about 6x longer than alkaline batteries would last, or if they live up to the claim of 8x then I'll get 16 months out of them. Either way I'll be saving a lot of time and money not having to swap out batteries every few months, I can now put it on my yearly to-do list instead.I also use the 9V batteries in my smoke detectors, and according to the specs they should only need to be changed every 10 years instead of the 2 years that I was getting with alkalines. Sure they are 5-7x more expensive (depending if you buy in bulk or not), but I'll gladly pay that price to not have to get up on a ladder in the middle of the night to swap out beeping smoke detector batteries all the time.Amazon Basics Batteries:The only reason they didn't get 5 stars is because you can't really use them in products that have a higher voltage demand like you would get with the Energizer lithium. For the most part, they will perform like all the major brand with the exception of Rayovac. I find these last longer than then. As for regular Energizer and Duracell, I feel the difference is negligible. Some may or may not last longer than the Amazon brand while the others WILL last longer. I suppose it depends on the application they are used for.So in turn, yes I would recommend these to the typical consumer. The price is cheaper, the quality should be comparable to the rest. I would give them a try. If they are crappy then youre out a couple of bucks. Probably the same price when you decided to order the liver and onions you didnt like at so and so :P",AmazonBasics AAA Performance Alkaline Batteries (36 Count),positive,amazon product line seems decent products batteries exception many reviewers say batteries terrible good great awesome unsurpassed etc seems general consensus batteries great intended purposefirst recommend take look c httpswwwamazoncomgppdpprofilea35h8y36s43csgrefcmcrdppdp review highly credible review put time effort test batteries said two cents batteries previously bought amazonrayovac smart choice portable digital electronics lasting little less long leading brands perfect powering lowdrain devices like clocks radios remote controls lowpowered flashlights youre looking affordable reliable battery get works 35 uses using eyelash curler good cheap batteries use simple things dont require lot power computer mouse last long price pay dont expect want quick battery isnt going cost couple dollars usually go theseduracelldespite shorter use date 32021 recently purchased energizer industrial aaa alkalines 122026 procell duracell alkaline aaa cells highest open circuit voltage ive ever measured admit price shopper opting 48 15 prime rather 24 11 get results similar procell aa cells recently purchased aaas good performers sadly tootight fit use recent surefire titan flashlight one aaa cell led flashlight surefire received decent life batteries besides using flashlight remote control car remote smoke alarm 7 months others good batteries right priceenergizeri used mouse computer xbox 360 remote cable box remote part feels like didnt last long could mouse never gets shut xbox gets used relatively often im gamer use system watch moviesi read reviews people say one sellers selling used batteries didnt experience mine arrived package didnt seem tampered prior shippingi ordered duracell procell batteries want see theyll last longer notenergizer lithiumi put batteries electronic zwave door locks duracell alkaline batteries using dying quickly theyd last 2 months rechargeable ones would last 34 weeks locks lowdrain time sitting unlock lock uses large burst energy thats exactly type device lithium batteries recommended used installed 4 months ago theyre still showing 100 charge system control panel granted moves 25 levels could anywhere 76100 still even depleted rate 25 every 4 months means theyll good least 1 year replaced thats 6x longer alkaline batteries would last live claim 8x ill get 16 months either way ill saving lot time money swap batteries every months put yearly todo list insteadi also use 9v batteries smoke detectors according specs need changed every 10 years instead 2 years getting alkalines sure 57x expensive depending buy bulk ill gladly pay price get ladder middle night swap beeping smoke detector batteries timeamazon basics batteriesthe reason didnt get 5 stars cant really use products higher voltage demand like would get energizer lithium part perform like major brand exception rayovac find last longer regular energizer duracell feel difference negligible may may last longer amazon brand others last longer suppose depends application used forso turn yes would recommend typical consumer price cheaper quality comparable rest would give try crappy youre couple bucks probably price decided order liver onions didnt like p,0

5,"I'm always in search of the best reviewed and most economical AAA batteries I can find, because we use a LOT of them. I've bought from Costco, Groupon and other online retailers.These might qualify as the longest-lasting, most economical batteries I have yet found, given that they were on sale sometime Thanksgiving and Christmas. They arrived quicker than I expected. 100 batteries, shrinkwrapped in groups of 4, all perfectly packaged in a small-but-heavy plain brown box. It was a pleasure to receive and open the box. The batteries themselves looked very plain, almost generic although they did have the AmazonBasics label on them.But that was just icing on the cake for the way these batteries performed. I use a lot of flashlights and headlamps due to age-related reduction in my visual acuity. I also use AAA operated Sennheiser headphones for listening to TV and other audio devices. These are all pretty high-draw devices and they get a lot of use.Keeping in mind that these were the first Amazon batteries I ever purchased, I monitored them pretty closely. Compared to the other batteries I bought, these are still wowing me. Previously, I swore by the Costco batteries, but so far these AmazonBasic left the Costco batteries in the dust. In the Sennheisers I've only changed the AmazonBasics batteries once since installing them almost a month ago. More typically, I have to change them out every week-and-a-half. I don't know if the difference is because the Amazon batteries are fresher or what. But the difference is most pronounced.So. Based on this one purchase, I can recommend that you at least give these a try. Maybe I was just lucky on this purchase. But the more I use them, the more impressed I am with them. I will buy these again in the future and if my opinion changes, I will update this review.

I thought that batteries would be a good first try since there really can't be much difference between alkaline batteries.I am a working musician teacher. I sing with a band and use a Shure Wireless Beta 58 mic. A normal set of alkaline batteries last about 7-8 hours in my mic. The first gig I used these with was about 3 1/2 hours with the mic on and by the end of the gig the light on the mic showing battery was showing that the battery was about to die. I was just lucky that it lasted long enough for the entire gig. Usually I can get two full gigs out of an alkaline battery. Just as a comparison, I usually buy the cheapest boxes of batteries at Lowe's. Those batteries are only slightly more expensive than the Amazon Basics and last twice as long in my mic.I can't say how these batteries work in other things, but I can say that for what I use them for they are a big waste of money.

First off the price was definitely better than buying even store brand batteries at a local store. It was definitely cheaper than buying brand name.

I like that because the batteries stay nice and organized even once you open the package. The single packages inside are easy to open too. You just twist them and they break open so it's not like you have to grab scissors or a knife.As far as using them they work just fine. I'm no scientist so I've never sat down and done some experiment on these to track the use, but I can't tell the difference from when I was buying Duracell or Energizer or any other battery.We have used them in all kinds of kids toys, in remote controls and in our Xbox 360 controller. They seem to hold up well and I have not had any that did not work.Since I can't tell a difference in how they work or how long they last I will definitely get these since they are cheaper.

There's chocolate sauce all over the 'piano' and the table. It wasn't chocolate sauce. It was battery acid. As he said, good thing I didn't taste it!For what it's worth, the keyboard was plugged in, and it had not been turned on or played since the batteries were installed. The five new batteries were in place for about 18 hours before the leak was discovered.The green seal fell off of two of the five batteries as I removed them from the compartment. The acid left a 2 stain on my table.The other batteries that I installed that day still seem to be okay, although I've developed a paranoia about checking them! I have used Amazon batteries in the past with no problems, which is why I'm giving 2 stars, instead of 1. The attached photo shows the rings that fell off.

5,"With an Income Tax Preparation practice I'm on my laptop 10 hours a day entering data. Using the laptop keyboard and mouse pad on the flat and level angle that laptops offer is stressful. An elevated keyboard serves the purpose of 'tilting' the keyboard into a natural position for typing. This AmazonBasic Ventilated and Adjustable laptop stand is perfect and produces the effect of a typewriter slant for those who grew up on IBM Selectrics or Royals. Fully adjustable for just about any angle you are comfortable with. Well made, light weight and it looks as a 'piece of the laptop' in sight. One small warning: the tabs on the front end that keep your laptop from sliding off may be a bit short for some laptops. The tabs rise only .75 of an inch (3/4). My current, and several past laptops, the front sits 1.0 inches (1) at top front but slanting down at .75 of an inch (3/4) inward. The slant keeps the tabs on the stand from holding the laptop in place - causing the laptop to slip down and off. Simple solution to this: Binder Clips. Use the medium size binder clip, one on each of the stand tabs. You can find 'binder clips' on the Amazon web site. A box is under 4 but you only need 2 medium binder clips so . . . check with a school teacher or office worker and get two for free. Other than that, the right tool at the right price. Buy one and see for yourself. You'll be glad you did.",AmazonBasics Ventilated Adjustable Laptop Stand,positive,income tax preparation practice im laptop 10 hours day entering data using laptop keyboard mouse pad flat level angle laptops offer stressful elevated keyboard serves purpose tilting keyboard natural position typing amazonbasic ventilated adjustable laptop stand perfect produces effect typewriter slant grew ibm selectrics royals fully adjustable angle comfortable well made light weight looks piece laptop sight one small warning tabs front end keep laptop sliding may bit short laptops tabs rise 75 inch 34 current several past laptops front sits 10 inches 1 top front slanting 75 inch 34 inward slant keeps tabs stand holding laptop place causing laptop slip simple solution binder clips use medium size binder clip one stand tabs find binder clips amazon web site box 4 need 2 medium binder clips check school teacher office worker get two free right tool right price buy one see youll glad,3
4,"Simple in its design, with multiple angles, the mesh keeps your laptop cool, the cord keeper in back keeps organized, and the surface area is great for a 15.6 laptop. I think this would also work for a 17 laptop, but there may be a larger model for those. Check first. The only gripe I have about this unit is the two 'tabs' that keep the laptop from sliding down into your lap when adjusted up at an angle. These two tabs could benefit from being 1/2 taller than they are. This would allow a 'thicker' laptop base from 'spillage' like my Toshiba seems to occasionally do. So that is my only con for this item. I would still suggest buying it.",AmazonBasics Ventilated Adjustable Laptop Stand,positive,simple design multiple angles mesh keeps laptop cool cord keeper back keeps organized surface area great 156 laptop think would also work 17 laptop may larger model check first gripe unit two tabs keep laptop sliding lap adjusted angle two tabs could benefit 12 taller would allow thicker laptop base spillage like toshiba seems occasionally con item would still suggest buying,3

4,"Every other laptop cooler I have purchased has a USB plug to run a fan. Got tired of the fans making noise, the USB or cooler plug not working eventually etc.So gave this one a shot and it does what it says plus. Keeps my 15.6 Mac book pro cool and my legs are not heating up any more when sitting on the couch. Also the bottom does not feel nearly as hot as it used to. So why only 4 stars. The two tabs to keep your laptop from sliding off are not adjustable so when you are typing your arms want to rest on those tabs. Really uncomfortable. So in the pictures you can see a slight modification I made to alleviate this problem. I now rest the laptop on the pads so when typing my arms are resting on the key board portion as if the tabs were not there. Much more comfortable. I used strips of thick felt with sticky bottoms. Certainly not a technical fix but does the job. All they had to do was include a metal piece retrofit on the bottom portion that would allow you to raise your computer to a level so the tabs would not interfere. Simple but maybe on the next model.

4,"PROS:Well made/good constructionCompares very favorably to famous brand-name packsNo obvious brandingGreat attention to detailLarge main compartmentLots of subcompartmentsOrganizer for pens/sundries in the front compartmentCONS:Generic looksTop handle is minimally padded/perfunctoryStiff nylon in some interior parts makes an audible 'crinkly' sound when movedThe AmazonBasics Laptop Backpack is a well-made, fully featured backpack that can accommodate laptops up to 17 inches wide. This is a simply designed but good looking backpack that could meet most students' needs.The bag is basically a simple, but stylish enough design, with grey highlights and some orange piping on the front. There are enough characteristics to make the bag distinctive but there is no obvious branding on the front. If you look closely, you can find the Amazon basics logo embossed on the black zippers. But you'd have to look really closely. The shoulder straps are backed with a mesh-like material that reduces slippage and are sufficiently wide and padded so that they are comfortable.The main compartment is generous in size, open and closed with two zippers, and is basically broken up into two areas. The back area is generously padded on both sides and is meant to house the laptop. The padding is as good as or even more generous than what I have seen in standard backpacks made by companies like JanSport or L.L. Bean. There is a single large sleeve in front of the padding that is large enough to hold a standard, letter-sized manilla folder filled with papers. The front compartment is basically wide open and has room for traditional textbooks (assuming people still use these) or any other paraphernalia.There are two compartments in the front. There is mid-sized compartment that is in front of the main compartment and a smaller front compartment with the obligatory organizer/pockets to hold pens, a cellphone etc. There is even an internal clip in the front compartment for keys.Additionally, there are small mesh pockets on the sides of the pack and a quick-access, zippered pocket on the very top of the pack. There's even a small mesh pocket on the bottom of the left shoulder strap.Although I doubt that this is ballistic nylon, it appears to be very well made. The edges line up very well and there is no dog-earing in the fabric. The top handle is only minimally padded and a bit flimsy for a pack this size. Clearly, you could lift the pack via the handle to move it from the floor to your desk, but the handle isn't comfortable or sturdy enough to carry the pack like a suitcase. The nylon that makes up the dividers is stiff and makes an audible crinkly sound when manipulated. This likely will go away over time, but if you are late to class and walking into a quiet lecture hall this could be a distraction.The zippers move easily. They are large enough to grip and they all have nylon tags sewn to the end to make them easier to pull. The zippers seem strong enough for a pack of this size and caliber.All-in-all this is a very well made back pack at an excellent price point. It may not win major style points for some students, but it is a great basic backpack.",AmazonBasics Backpack for Laptops up to 17-inches,positive,proswell madegood constructioncompares favorably famous brandname packsno obvious brandinggreat attention detaillarge main compartmentlots subcompartmentsorganizer penssundries front compartmentconsgeneric lookstop handle minimally paddedperfunctorystiff nylon interior parts makes audible crinkly sound movedthe amazonbasics laptop backpack wellmade fully featured backpack accommodate laptops 17 inches wide simply designed good looking backpack could meet students needsthe bag basically simple stylish enough design grey highlights orange piping front enough characteristics make bag distinctive obvious branding front look closely find amazon basics logo embossed black zippers youd look really closely shoulder straps backed meshlike material reduces slippage sufficiently wide padded comfortablethe main compartment generous size open closed two zippers basically broken two areas back area generously padded sides meant house laptop padding good even generous seen standard backpacks made companies like jansport bean single large sleeve front padding large enough hold standard lettersized manilla folder filled papers front compartment basically wide open room traditional textbooks assuming people still use paraphernaliathere two compartments front midsized compartment front main compartment smaller front compartment obligatory organizerpockets hold pens cellphone etc even internal clip front compartment keysadditionally small mesh pockets sides pack quickaccess zippered pocket top pack theres even small mesh pocket bottom left shoulder strapalthough doubt ballistic nylon appears well made edges line well dogearing fabric top handle minimally padded bit flimsy pack size clearly could lift pack via handle move floor desk handle isnt comfortable sturdy enough carry pack like suitcase nylon makes dividers stiff makes audible crinkly sound manipulated likely go away time late class walking quiet lecture hall could distractionthe zippers move easily large enough grip nylon tags sewn end make easier pull zippers seem strong enough pack size caliberallinall well made back pack excellent price point may win major style points students great basic backpack,3

I needed something to carry my laptop where I could easily remove it for security, and that had lots of pockets for my travel papers and various things I needed to keep my 6yo busy.This AmazonBasics laptop is well-made and sturdy with a variety of pocket sizes and places to put stuff. Whatever material they used for the inside of the bag makes it very loud and crinkly, but also easy to clean. There is at least one pocket that seems extraneous and almost gets in the way, and when all the pockets are closed, there is an over abundance of zipper pulls. But the bag traveled very well and I like the sleeker style of it.The backpack is a bit much for everyday use (just in bulk and number of pockets, etc), but I'm happy to have it for future travels.",AmazonBasics Backpack for Laptops up to 17-inches,positive,ordered backpack anticipation 10day vacation universal studios royal caribbean cruise needed something carry laptop could easily remove security lots pockets travel papers various things needed keep 6yo busythis amazonbasics laptop wellmade sturdy variety pocket sizes places put stuff whatever material used inside bag makes loud crinkly also easy clean least one pocket seems extraneous almost gets way pockets closed abundance zipper pulls bag traveled well like sleeker style itthe backpack bit much everyday use bulk number pockets etc im happy future travels,3

There is even a secondary pocket on the front of the laptop pouch that can fit my 8 tablet. Overall I really like it because it has so many pockets and little compartments. The only bad thing I can see about it is how they made it so cheap is that the material inside for like the pockets and stuff is really flimsy so it'll be easily punctured by pens and pencils and stuff. For me though that's no big deal because the outside of it is sturdy and will keep my stuff safe.,AmazonBasics Backpack for Laptops up to 17-inches,positive,expecting backpack little flimsy consider price great padding back laptop pocket nice thick even secondary pocket front laptop pouch fit 8 tablet overall really like many pockets little compartments bad thing see made cheap material inside like pockets stuff really flimsy itll easily punctured pens pencils stuff though thats big deal outside sturdy keep stuff safe,3
5,"I'm a lifelong backpack user, starting back after WW2 when my father outfitted us all with Army surplus items. Hi ho, hi ho, it's off to hike we go. Or snowshoe. Oh, it was a different world then, and I'm not saying better. The equipment was heavy and prone to mildew if you weren't careful, as it was all made of natural fiber with metal fittings. And they hadn't yet heard of ergonomicsHere we have yet another AmazonBasics product that is a winner. An improved, contemporary version of that old military surplus that first accompanied us into the woods - I've followed a lifetime of upgrades. This is a nice big bag with lots of pockets and zippers. Like most of today's technical products, it is a tradeoff between total protection and portability. So no, you wouldn't throw this with your laptop inside and expect complete protection. But it is made of high quality nylon and other tekkie fabrics, has adequate padding and well shaped, comfortable pack straps, a handle on top where it belongs, and more straps, buckles and pockets here and there. I love straps, buckles and pockets.It can be expected to be water resistant, although for extended use in rain you would need a separate rain cover made of coated waterproof nylon. This backpack has a very pleasing look, mostly black with orange accents and is a nice conservative shape. And it is a very good value, which you will discover if you go shopping at the well-known places for this kind of thing.",AmazonBasics Backpack for Laptops up to 17-inches,positive,im lifelong backpack user starting back ww2 father outfitted us army surplus items hi ho hi ho hike go snowshoe oh different world im saying better equipment heavy prone mildew werent careful made natural fiber metal fittings hadnt yet heard ergonomicshere yet another amazonbasics product winner improved contemporary version old military surplus first accompanied us woods ive followed lifetime upgrades nice big bag lots pockets zippers like todays technical products tradeoff total protection portability wouldnt throw laptop inside expect complete protection made high quality nylon tekkie fabrics adequate padding well shaped comfortable pack straps handle top belongs straps buckles pockets love straps buckles pocketsit expected water resistant although extended use rain would need separate rain cover made coated waterproof nylon backpack pleasing look mostly black orange accents nice conservative shape good value discover go shopping wellknown places kind thing,3

5,"""As a bluetooth speaker, the Tap rocks! The sound quality is excellent, plenty loud when needed, and excellent quality with no stutters in streaming. I bought this one instead of the Echo because it is portable, and I can lug it from room to room. The charging stand is very convenient, and the Tap stays there most of the time. Having to press the button to activate each of the voice commands is not an issue for me, but is something to consider. (If you want hands free use, you may want the big brother Echo device, which is hands free, but tethered in place by a power cord, so not portable). The feel of the Tap with the black fabric cover is nice, and will not slip out of your hand. The fabric is like tough upholstery cover, so it won't stain or be easy to damage, but is quite attractive. I am glad they did that, as bare plastic would be easy to drop. I found it easy to pair with bluetooth and wireless, and it works as advertised! I mostly just use it for playing music and asking Alexa silly questions for fun! I occasionally use it for shopping lists, which shows up on my phone, and checking the weather. Who knows what the future holds,when I have time to sit down and really learn all that it can do? I understand that Amazon plans to add more Alexa skills all the time, and if one got into smart house control with compatible products, the Tap would eliminate all remotes, which I already have too many of. I think it is a really fun, cool item, and I am glad I got it! It is so much fun to use voice commands instead of typing, especially the tiny smart phone typing ! I could get used to this! I have the Alexa app on my phone, which allows certain voice commands to show up on my phone, like shopping lists, to do lists, calendar. The Tap can also check traffic, weather, movies, etc directly through Wi Fi, no phone needed. However, the Alexa phone app actually helps you figure out what you can do with the Tap. The Tap can read Audible and some kindle ebooks to you as well! BTW, I haven't had any problems having it understand me, which is amazing, since I grew up in Texas and expected a problem with my accent. Obviously, this item is ideal for people who are Amazon Prime members, so you can stream Prime Music, although it also streams Pandora and other music services, and does many things without any connection to Amazon. I guess the most unique thing about the Tap is its ability to stream wi fi music directly, without a computer or phone driving it - that and the voice control.

I'm guessing I'm comparing it with the Bose mini soundlink. When you set the volume high, the bass is almost non-existent. The mids and highs are loud with the louder volume. Another difference is that with tap, you have to press the mic button to start saying commands where as with the echo, you can just say the wake up word and it will start listening to your commands. I do like the fact that it's portable.

The Tap is smaller than I thought it was...about 2/3rd the size of the Echo..which is perfect for portability...But don't let the size fool you the sound is only short of Bose when it comes to volume and sound quality. Important note...You don't have to have an Echo to use this device...just The Alexa App on your smart phone. The Tap does everything the Echo does..It is an Amazing Bluetooth speaker...AND IT""""S PORTABLE!!! Automatically switches/remembers different WiFi areas and can be used with a Hot Spot. The Most Amazing thing about the Whole Amazon Echo System is that Amazon keeps making enhancements and partnerships weekly.

I like them.I have read only three books on the Kindle so far and I still haven't mastered the touch of getting it to do what I want when I want. I am fighting it to highlight, and tap like a madman to change between page number and time left in the chapter/book (which are features I love).Excellent reader. I would purchase again, but I can't say with any honesty that the extra $100 was worth it over the Paperwhite, but I have no experience with that model either.

4,"I am a big fan of e-readers. I prefer the e-ink screens over tablet screen when reading books. I decided to pick up the new Kindle Voyage. Here are my thoughts.First, the Kindle is much sleeker and lighter than the Paperwhite model. It's very easy to hold for a long length of time without getting tired.Secondly, the addition of the page turn buttons is a welcomed addition. The buttons make it so easy to hold the Kindle with one hand and turn pages.Lastly the screen. I marked off a star because I had to return my first Voyage directly to Amazon because the top half of the screen had a yellow tint to it that was very distracting while reading. The replacement Kindle Voyage that I received had a perfect screen and the 300 ppi looks amazing. That being said, Amazon needs to really focus on quality control because I've read that the yellow tint on the screen is a common issue. If you're spending $200 for an e-reader, then the screen should be perfect. Especially since this is the 3rd generation of the lighted screens for the e-readers.If you're an avid reader, then the Kindle Voyage would be a worthy upgrade to make. If you're a casual reader who has a Paperwhite, you're probably okay with what you have.","Kindle Voyage E-reader, 6 High-Resolution Display (300 ppi) with Adaptive Built-in Light, PagePress Sensors, Wi-Fi - Includes Special Offers",positive,big fan ereaders prefer eink screens tablet screen reading books decided pick new kindle voyage thoughtsfirst kindle much sleeker lighter paperwhite model easy hold long length time without getting tiredsecondly addition page turn buttons welcomed addition buttons make easy hold kindle one hand turn pageslastly screen marked star return first voyage directly amazon top half screen yellow tint distracting reading replacement kindle voyage received perfect screen 300 ppi looks amazing said amazon needs really focus quality control ive read yellow tint screen common issue youre spending 200 ereader screen perfect especially since 3rd generation lighted screens ereadersif youre avid reader kindle voyage would worthy upgrade make youre casual reader paperwhite youre probably okay,3

4,"The voyage is a great e reader for the avid reader. It's not a tablet so don't expect features of an internet tablet. However the auto-adjust backlight feature & minimal flash between pages makes it ideal for readers. This version includes the vocabulary builder, which I find myself using a lot nowadays. However, I'm not sure why it's more expensive than the paperwhite. That's the one I actually wanted but my local store was out of stock. I thought it included the 3g so you can download even when away from wifi but it doesn't. So that's why I'm confused on the price difference. The overall feel of it is fine. Not a lot thinner than the original. I keep mine in a case and whenever it goes idle I have to take it out of the case just to press the power button, which is pretty inconvenient. Oh and it freezes when charging which made me extremely nervous the first time because I thought it was broken but I just held the power button for like ten seconds and it was fine... other than those very minor complaints,I love it. I find myself reading way more than watching tv these days so that's always a plus!","Kindle Voyage E-reader, 6 High-Resolution Display (300 ppi) with Adaptive Built-in Light, PagePress Sensors, Wi-Fi - Includes Special Offers",positive,voyage great e reader avid reader tablet dont expect features internet tablet however autoadjust backlight feature minimal flash pages makes ideal readers version includes vocabulary builder find using lot nowadays however im sure expensive paperwhite thats one actually wanted local store stock thought included 3g download even away wifi doesnt thats im confused price difference overall feel fine lot thinner original keep mine case whenever goes idle take case press power button pretty inconvenient oh freezes charging made extremely nervous first time thought broken held power button like ten seconds fine minor complaintsi love find reading way watching tv days thats always plus,3

While faster than paperwhite it is still way less responsive than an iPad, it is very hard to type on it (when searching or sharing on goodreads for instance).I like the navigation areas on the edge of the screen but I'm not crazy about them. I'm not sure what would be a better alternative but they are not all that comfortable while reading in bed. I guess a thumb swipe would still be better if the device would respond more nicely.I previously had a Paperwhite which got lost and I thought I'd better buy the latest kindle now.When I bought the paperwhite it has been an experiment, as I'm not an avid reader and I have a hard time reading paper book since I got surrounded by gadgets. I actually read few books on the paperwhite and I enjoyed it. So when I lost it (misplaced it) I was longing for it as I had few books I wanted to read.If this would be priced at least $50 cheaper I think it would be a 5 star proposition.

(I shut her off since I'm not a fan of conversing with computers).My main complaint is that comes with nothing but a charger and cable. The wordless, pictorialstart up instructions were primitive and vague. There are no instructions on how to use thisdevice; no sample book to test and get familiar with. There is a help function thatfills in some basics of functionality but not thorough enough. The WiFi connectivity is great, using the latest protocol and encryption. It has a simple web browser but web time also seems to be the greatest drain on the battery. The cable can be used toattach to a Windows PC and transfer files (books, music, pictures etc).

5,"I bought this for my son who is a product of the times and takes very easily to electronics and touch screen devices. My mother bought him a subscription to the ABC Mouse learning program and we needed a kid friendly device for him to use it on. At first I was skeptical about spending the extra 50 for the kids fire as I thought it was mainly for the case which I thought to be cheap silicon. When the tablet arrived in the mail I was surprised to find that the enclosure is a thick, heavy duty type of foam. It provides a good enclosure for the kids to hang onto as well as a solid defender against any drops. It booted up quickly and once you enter your amazon information, you have the ability to set up both an account for adults and a child's account.The child's account does not have access to the app store or anything that you don't want them to get a hold of.You can set time limits on their account to your desire.You can allow and disallow any application you want to their account.It comes with a year subscription to amazons free time unlimited, which I interpreted as basically Prime for kids. This allows access to all the apps and games as much as they want.The kids user interface is extremely slim and easy to navigate. He is able to one click to any apps, books, games he wants to use. It also highlights your recently used apps in the carousel at the top.Overall I'm very happy with the purchase of this tablet as it allows him to use modern technology to learn and grow without worrying about the normal dangers the Internet holds if you're not careful.","Fire Kids Edition Tablet, 7 Display, Wi-Fi, 16 GB, Pink Kid-Proof Case",positive,bought son product times takes easily electronics touch screen devices mother bought subscription abc mouse learning program needed kid friendly device use first skeptical spending extra 50 kids fire thought mainly case thought cheap silicon tablet arrived mail surprised find enclosure thick heavy duty type foam provides good enclosure kids hang onto well solid defender drops booted quickly enter amazon information ability set account adults childs accountthe childs account access app store anything dont want get hold ofyou set time limits account desireyou allow disallow application want accountit comes year subscription amazons free time unlimited interpreted basically prime kids allows access apps games much wantthe kids user interface extremely slim easy navigate able one click apps books games wants use also highlights recently used apps carousel topoverall im happy purchase tablet allows use modern technology learn grow without worrying normal dangers internet holds youre careful,3
5,"my 2 year old daughter loves this tablet! I witnessed her drop it once (off the couch to laminate floor) nothing I can tell was affected. I was a little reluctant to buy this for such a young child, but with the way we seem to rely on technology these days, plus the cost, I just had to buy it. my favorite feature is the parental controls that allow me to set times ...not just times that it can be used but for certain content as well! I can set the tablet so when my older kids (10 and 8) log in, they need to complete educational tasks for an allotted amount of time before free play... and the whole thing logs out after a certain time so I don't have to go searching for it in their rooms at night :) great tablet, glad I got the bumper too, great price","Fire Kids Edition Tablet, 7 Display, Wi-Fi, 16 GB, Pink Kid-Proof Case",positive,2 year old daughter loves tablet witnessed drop couch laminate floor nothing tell affected little reluctant buy young child way seem rely technology days plus cost buy favorite feature parental controls allow set times times used certain content well set tablet older kids 10 8 log need complete educational tasks allotted amount time free play whole thing logs certain time dont go searching rooms night great tablet glad got bumper great price,3

4,Great price of 89 dollars on a great tablet. It is very fast at everything accept game play. For example it plays asphalt 8 and the game is just barely playable.

So that being said I did return this tablet and ordered the Nvidia Shield 8 inch tablet through Best Buy for 199 dollars. I got the Shield a week ago and WOW!! What a difference in graphic gaming quality. This thing is just as good as an Xbox1 or ps4. The Nvidia Shield tablet is simply unbelievable for the price of 199 considering the Apple or Samsung tablets that are as fast as this tablet are at least twice the cost. Plus this dubbles as a gaming console for xbox or pc games with 4k out to you tv. The Amazon tablet is also a great tablet for normal usage but if your a gamer like me the Nvidia tablet is the tablet of choice hands down period!! I don't know why bbuy kind of hides the Nvidia tab only on their website and doesn't sell it in the store. If they displayed it in the store. This would outsell the Apple or Samsung tablets.

5,"This is a great tablet for younger users (i'd say up to 10 years old). Performance is not on par with higher end tablets, but it is fine for younger children. The best thing about this tablet is that it comes with a 2 year no questions asked replacement warranty. This even covers cracked screens. My kids 3, 5, and 8 use these tablets on long trips. They are able to play all of their favorite games. The Amazon play store underground is excellent. It has many of their favorite games, but in app purchases are included for those games.Pros: 2 year no questions replacement policy. performance for younger children, amazon underground.Cons: display is not HD, battery life is not the best.Note there is a newer model of this device that was just released. It adds a higher resolution display and better battery life. However the new model costs 129.99 when not on sale.Overall I would recommend this tablet for children 10 and younger.

5,"When they first announced the Kindle Oasis, I did not have much of a desire to upgrade from my 1st generation Kindle Paperwhite. Just as I felt when they announced the Voyage.I read a lot, so my Kindle travels with me throughout the day most of the time. I have never had an issue with battery life, I have only had it get really low a few times (typically when I was traveling). So again, I originally did not see a lot of the value to the Oasis.As the reviews for the Oasis came out, I started to realize what I did not like about my Paperwhite, and I began to have an interest in upgrading my Paperwhite to the either the Oasis or possibly the Voyage. The main thing I noticed is that I took my Paperwhite out of the Amazon case quite a lot, especially when I was in a seated position. This slight reduction in weight made it much more comfortable to hold for longer reading sessions. I had some other minor issues with my Paperwhite, like when reading in the dark, I couldn't find an adjustment for the light that I preferred (5 was a little too dim and 6 was a brighter than I needed). I decided to pass on the Voyage because I really did not like the case options and the pressure sensitive page turn option.Now that I have the Oasis, I definitely think it was worth it for me. I really appreciate the reduced weight when the cover is off (not to mention the ease of removing the cover compared to the Paperwhite). It provides the same reading experience, although I did get a resolution upgrade compared to my older Paperwhite, which is a plus.The Oasis is really comfortable in my hand, which helps me forget that it is there. When I was holding my Paperwhite with my left hand, at times I would accidentally go back a page, which drove me crazy even though its just a minor inconvenience.I have the black model because it was the only option available unless I was willing to wait a few more months. The build quality of the Oasis and its case is very nice, just like with the Paperwhite and the amazon leather case for it. The only concern I have is how well it will protect the Kindle. I will update the review if I find this to be a problem.I loved my Paperwhite, and I will recommend it to anyone looking to upgrade from an older Kindle or buying one for the first time. It definitely is great and the better buy, but I am glad I decided to order the Oasis. The reduced weight, ergonomic design, and page turn buttons make it worth the added cost.","Kindle Oasis E-reader with Leather Charging Cover - Black, 6 High-Resolution Display (300 ppi), Wi-Fi - Includes Special Offers",positive,first announced kindle oasis much desire upgrade 1st generation kindle paperwhite felt announced voyagei read lot kindle travels throughout day time never issue battery life get really low times typically traveling originally see lot value oasisas reviews oasis came started realize like paperwhite began interest upgrading paperwhite either oasis possibly voyage main thing noticed took paperwhite amazon case quite lot especially seated position slight reduction weight made much comfortable hold longer reading sessions minor issues paperwhite like reading dark couldnt find adjustment light preferred 5 little dim 6 brighter needed decided pass voyage really like case options pressure sensitive page turn optionnow oasis definitely think worth really appreciate reduced weight cover mention ease removing cover compared paperwhite provides reading experience although get resolution upgrade compared older paperwhite plusthe oasis really comfortable hand helps forget holding paperwhite left hand times would accidentally go back page drove crazy even though minor inconveniencei black model option available unless willing wait months build quality oasis case nice like paperwhite amazon leather case concern well protect kindle update review find problemi loved paperwhite recommend anyone looking upgrade older kindle buying one first time definitely great better buy glad decided order oasis reduced weight ergonomic design page turn buttons make worth added cost,3
5,"Even when I‚Äôm outside in bright sunlight, the words of the book I‚Äôm reading are still crystal clear. That alone makes the Kindle Oasis worth what it cost me.The Kindle Oasis wakes up in just seconds, and any book I choose instantly opens, ready to be read.It is the perfect size and isn‚Äôt heavy or bulky. I really do read for hours at a time. Sometimes I pace the floor while I read. Sometimes I‚Äôm on my elliptical machine when I read. And sometimes I‚Äôm sitting down. No matter what I‚Äôm doing, the Kindle Oasis remains comfortable to hold, and it is always easy on my eyes.When I receive a book that is in PDF, most of the time I can enlarge the words. If it won‚Äôt allow me to enlarge the words, I can change the orientation of the page and the words are automatically larger. I am able to make notes on the book if needed, and I can highlight words and/or passages.My merlot leather cover is attractive. When I flip it open, it is just like opening the cover of a book.How to Make the Battery LastOn the Kindle Oasis page, it says that its ‚Äúdual-battery charging system delivers months of battery life.‚Äù This was a huge thing for me. Instead of having to charge my tablet almost every day, I would be able to read for months without charging the Kindle!Is this how my Oasis has performed? Well, not so much. There are conditions that have to be met for the charge on your Oasis to last for two months.First, you have to limit your reading to thirty minutes a day. That one is impossible for me. There are days that I am only able to read for thirty minutes, but they don‚Äôt occur very often. My Kindle goes everywhere with me, and I use just about every spare moment to read.Second, the wireless needs to be turned off. That one is easy to do but not always easy to remember. The only time the wireless needs to be on is to download one or more books.Third, this is based on your light setting at 10. That is way too low for me. I keep my light setting anywhere from 16 to 18.I don‚Äôt limit my reading to thirty minutes a day, and I try to remember to keep my wireless turned off. My light setting is kept anywhere from 16 to 18, and I put my Kindle to sleep the second I‚Äôm done reading. So how long does a single charge last me? Ten days is the longest a charge has lasted me so far, but it would have kept a charge for several more days if I had remembered to turn my wireless off. Once I succeed in keeping my wireless off, I will let you know how long the charge lasts.Now, I don‚Äôt plug it in to charge as soon as the charge on the cover gets low. I allow my cover charge to go as low as it will possibly go and then the Kindle battery will start to drain since it can no longer charge from the cover. I allow it to drain down to about 50% before I plug the cover and Kindle into my computer to charge.The one thing that surprised me was that everything on the Oasis is in black and white. For some reason, I thought that maybe the book covers would appear in color. But since I bought the Oasis to read books on, color isn‚Äôt needed.Special offers do appear on my screen but only when my Kindle is going to sleep or waking up. They aren‚Äôt a distraction, and to be honest, they are kind of fun to look at. You can pay a higher price so they won‚Äôt appear on your Kindle if you would rather not see them.I asked myself some questions once I had my Kindle and knew just how it worked. If I had known before I bought my Kindle Oasis that the charge wouldn‚Äôt last for months, would I still have bought it? Yes, I would have. If I had known that everything would appear in black and white, would I still have bought it? Yes, I would have.","Kindle Oasis E-reader with Leather Charging Cover - Black, 6 High-Resolution Display (300 ppi), Wi-Fi - Includes Special Offers",positive,even iäôm outside bright sunlight words book iäôm reading still crystal clear alone makes kindle oasis worth cost methe kindle oasis wakes seconds book choose instantly opens ready readit perfect size isnäôt heavy bulky really read hours time sometimes pace floor read sometimes iäôm elliptical machine read sometimes iäôm sitting matter iäôm kindle oasis remains comfortable hold always easy eyeswhen receive book pdf time enlarge words wonäôt allow enlarge words change orientation page words automatically larger able make notes book needed highlight words andor passagesmy merlot leather cover attractive flip open like opening cover bookhow make battery laston kindle oasis page says äúdualbattery charging system delivers months battery lifeäù huge thing instead charge tablet almost every day would able read months without charging kindleis oasis performed well much conditions met charge oasis last two monthsfirst limit reading thirty minutes day one impossible days able read thirty minutes donäôt occur often kindle goes everywhere use every spare moment readsecond wireless needs turned one easy always easy remember time wireless needs download one booksthird based light setting 10 way low keep light setting anywhere 16 18i donäôt limit reading thirty minutes day try remember keep wireless turned light setting kept anywhere 16 18 put kindle sleep second iäôm done reading long single charge last ten days longest charge lasted far would kept charge several days remembered turn wireless succeed keeping wireless let know long charge lastsnow donäôt plug charge soon charge cover gets low allow cover charge go low possibly go kindle battery start drain since longer charge cover allow drain 50 plug cover kindle computer chargethe one thing surprised everything oasis black white reason thought maybe book covers would appear color since bought oasis read books color isnäôt neededspecial offers appear screen kindle going sleep waking arenäôt distraction honest kind fun look pay higher price wonäôt appear kindle would rather see themi asked questions kindle knew worked known bought kindle oasis charge wouldnäôt last months would still bought yes would known everything would appear black white would still bought yes would,3
5,"""Despite not being able to get one of these from Amazon until late June due to apparent strong demand, Best Buy was able to get one to me on the day of its release, April 27. Well done Best Buy! Having owned several previous Kindles, including the most recent Paperwhite model, I was unprepared for how small and light this new Oasis model is -- reading about it is one thing, but actually holding one in your hand is something else entirely. The Oasis and its battery-charging cover together weigh only one ounce more than the latest Paperwhite with no case. The Oasis _without_ its cover feels impossibly light at 4.6 ounces. Size-wise, the Oasis is nearly a square shape at about 5"""" wide by 5.5"""" tall.

The fire was small enough that it was easy to put in my carry on and I didn't have to take it out for TSA screening.

I got a 64gb micro sd and set it all up with his books and favorite news sites and apps he would use, and re boxed it up as a gift. Well 5 months have passed and he has not put it down! He loves it! He reads his books, surfs and has become a news hound. Suddenly we have all sorts of political discussions haha - good thing we are on the same page for the most part. It‚Äôs great that he reads so much and has this as a hobby now that he is retired. What a fabulous gift this turned out to be. It‚Äôs pretty easy for him to use even though he was used to Apple devices. He rarely has questions and just loves streaming video to the Chromecast, reading the news and has burned through a lot of novels. No complaints.

We have an iPad for her, but it was getting very expensive because so many of the games have buttons that you can click which then tell you about things you need to buy and she would have to have them. This tablet restricts all in app purchasing. Yay! We tried the older version of this tablet but it kept freezing and did not perform well. But so far, this one works well. I have two requests to Amazon, and I am hoping that someone from Amazon reads my review so they can make this change. Please change Amazon Freetime so that it puts the story apps that are under apps into the books sections. There are many wonderful stories that are read out loud but they are in the apps section instead of the books section, so then when I restrict her tablet to books only, she can't access them. I would love it so much if you they would fix this. A few examples of the stories she can't access when I restrict her to books because they are considers apps are the following: Nighty Night!, Charlie Brown's, The Berenstain Bears, and Dino-Store Story. The other recommendation I have is to please hide from view the activities that are restricted. As it is now, she can see all the apps but gets an error message when she selects them. I really like this product, and I think it so great for children. It just needs a few little improvements to the Freetime interface.","All-New Fire HD 8 Kids Edition Tablet, 8 HD Display, 32 GB, Blue Kid-Proof Case",positive,got day came four year old daughter loves ipad getting expensive many games buttons click tell things need buy would tablet restricts app purchasing yay tried older version tablet kept freezing perform well far one works well two requests amazon hoping someone amazon reads review make change please change amazon freetime puts story apps apps books sections many wonderful stories read loud apps section instead books section restrict tablet books cant access would love much would fix examples stories cant access restrict books considers apps following nighty night charlie browns berenstain bears dinostore story recommendation please hide view activities restricted see apps gets error message selects really like product think great children needs little improvements freetime interface,3

I also ordered covers made of leather that will turn the tablets on when opened and off (sleep mode) when closed. I like the Alexa app and believe my grandkids will also. The tablet screen is large enough but not too large to handle. The processor is decent and although the operating version is a modified version of Android tailored for Amazon, it works fine. It is easy to use Kindle on this tablet and easy to find free or inexpensive books my grandkids will enjoy.

It has a lot of system lag, and Wifi reception is terrible even in areas where other devices show a strong signal!Also, you should know that you can't access any apps on the Google Play store; it's locked into Amazon. None of that bothers me because like I said, I only use it to read/listen to Kindle books, and this device works perfectly for that.

4,"There's no doubt that this is the best Kindle device available. The battery life is astonishing, and the design is unique and extremely ergonomic. Holding this in your hand is such a pleasurable experience, it fits like a glove. So what are the cons you may ask...For one, the battery life depends on the provided case. It acts like a travel charger in a sense. Why a con? Well, it limits your customization options. And there's no way to purchase other colors or replacements for it at this time. So, you best be cautious with it.And two, the price obviously! But if you take into account that you basically are given a premium case, the device itself is a premium device, and you have a traveling charge inside the case...It may almost even out. But a $290-$350 device is hard to justify when it's just for reading.Still would recommend to any fan of e-readers/reading","Kindle Oasis E-reader with Leather Charging Cover - Walnut, 6 High-Resolution Display (300 ppi), Wi-Fi - Includes Special Offers",positive,theres doubt best kindle device available battery life astonishing design unique extremely ergonomic holding hand pleasurable experience fits like glove cons may askfor one battery life depends provided case acts like travel charger sense con well limits customization options theres way purchase colors replacements time best cautious itand two price obviously take account basically given premium case device premium device traveling charge inside caseit may almost even 290350 device hard justify readingstill would recommend fan ereadersreading,3
5,"I have had every kindle since the first and this is by far the best. The screen was already great on the Voyage but the front light on this screen is more white and more evenly distributed. Physical page turn buttons are so much better than none or the haptic feedback type. They didn't include the automatically adaptive front light for some reason but I don't think I'll miss it much as I was always wont to fiddle with it on the Voyage anyway.But this device made me smile as soon as I held it for the first time because it has a larger bezel that you can really grip comfortably without touching the screen. Maybe this isn't a big deal for most, but that is exactly why I spent the money to get this device.The other thing I was hoping for was the ability to use the upper page turn button to go forward and this device does that and even better because it is software configurable.The cover is very small and light and doesn't add much bulk like the Voyage Origami case does. The only downside is that it doesn't work as a hands free stand for reading.(I still wish it was waterproof)","Kindle Oasis E-reader with Leather Charging Cover - Walnut, 6 High-Resolution Display (300 ppi), Wi-Fi - Includes Special Offers",positive,every kindle since first far best screen already great voyage front light screen white evenly distributed physical page turn buttons much better none haptic feedback type didnt include automatically adaptive front light reason dont think ill miss much always wont fiddle voyage anywaybut device made smile soon held first time larger bezel really grip comfortably without touching screen maybe isnt big deal exactly spent money get devicethe thing hoping ability use upper page turn button go forward device even better software configurablethe cover small light doesnt add much bulk like voyage origami case downside doesnt work hands free stand readingi still wish waterproof,3

It is portable size so it fits almost anywhere when I travel, the book-like screen doesn't bother my eyes after long periods of time of reading, I can modify the font and size to my wants and needs, you can conveniently connect to your Goodreads account to view your bookshelves and all of my purchases sync perfectly.

5,"Its a great ereader but a little pricy. It has the same specs as the Voyage as far as pixels and procesor, which costs less. The only difference between this and the Voyage, is that it's much lighter, it's brighter (LEDs), and a longer battery life if you're using the cover. I've noticed the battery life drains much faster without the cover, but you'll still be able to read for hours without it. You would think it be water resistant, hence the name but it isn't. But then I don't plan on reading when it's raining or outside or while taking a bath. Overall, it's the best ereader Amazon currently has to offer but if you don't mind the price tag and want the best, then go for it! Voyage is still not a bad option though","Kindle Oasis E-reader with Leather Charging Cover - Walnut, 6 High-Resolution Display (300 ppi), Wi-Fi - Includes Special Offers",positive,great ereader little pricy specs voyage far pixels procesor costs less difference voyage much lighter brighter leds longer battery life youre using cover ive noticed battery life drains much faster without cover youll still able read hours without would think water resistant hence name isnt dont plan reading raining outside taking bath overall best ereader amazon currently offer dont mind price tag want best go voyage still bad option though,3

5,"As a previous several Kindle device owner I read a lot of reviews, many of them put the Voyage above it for various reasons, mainly price, or battery charging. But, after reading the pros and cons of both I still decided the Oasis was the direction I wanted to go, I could always return it and get the Voyage after all if I didn't like it. It's light, very well lit, comfortable to hold both in the case and out of it. The buttons improve the page turning experience, I see no dark areas on my screed from the LED lights, it holds a great battery charge (true not as good as my previous Kindle, but I still generally get around 3 weeks between charges), and it looks absolutely beautiful. I am very happy with this purchases and am glad I purchased the Oasis over the Voyage. It's expensive, and that's the major con, but if you want the best reading device this is it and worth it if you read enough.","Kindle Oasis E-reader with Leather Charging Cover - Walnut, 6 High-Resolution Display (300 ppi), Wi-Fi - Includes Special Offers",positive,previous several kindle device owner read lot reviews many put voyage various reasons mainly price battery charging reading pros cons still decided oasis direction wanted go could always return get voyage didnt like light well lit comfortable hold case buttons improve page turning experience see dark areas screed led lights holds great battery charge true good previous kindle still generally get around 3 weeks charges looks absolutely beautiful happy purchases glad purchased oasis voyage expensive thats major con want best reading device worth read enough,3
4,"I was used to the Kindle 3rd gen(Kindle Keyboard) and when i first held the Oasis it felt very odd and uncomfortable and the metal back made it feel like it could slip and fall at any second. It does take time to get used to. The device is expensive for something that is not even a colored screen. However, my main reason was because it was a bigger screen and clearer ( besides there doesn't seem to be much upgrades between the Kindle Keyboard and the other ones) I find myself accidently touching the touchscreen more often than I would like ( but much less than when I 1st got it- a week or so ago). All in all it is a sleek and nice device, alittle pricey.","All-New Kindle Oasis E-reader - 7 High-Resolution Display (300 ppi), Waterproof, Built-In Audible, 8 GB, Wi-Fi - Includes Special Offers",positive,used kindle 3rd genkindle keyboard first held oasis felt odd uncomfortable metal back made feel like could slip fall second take time get used device expensive something even colored screen however main reason bigger screen clearer besides doesnt seem much upgrades kindle keyboard ones find accidently touching touchscreen often would like much less 1st got week ago sleek nice device alittle pricey,3
4,"I was so looking forward to this that I bought it right when it popped up as available on Best Buy. This is obviously the most refined Kindle on the market as of now.

Fits perfectly in the palm and the page turn buttons are a joy to use.The charging case can be removed while reading and it snaps back easily, you do not have to deliberately align it properly. Once the case is connected it starts charging the Kindle which prolongs its battery life.In short, if you are an avid reader and can spare $290, this is the Kindle to buy. For occasional readers it might not make sense to spend so much and the Kindle Paperwhite should do just fine.","Kindle Oasis E-reader with Leather Charging Cover - Walnut, 6 High-Resolution Display (300 ppi), Wi-Fi - Includes Special Offers",positive,looking forward bought right popped available best buy obviously refined kindle market ergonomics perfect kindle ebook reader matter easy use single handed one fits perfectly palm page turn buttons joy usethe charging case removed reading snaps back easily deliberately align properly case connected starts charging kindle prolongs battery lifein short avid reader spare 290 kindle buy occasional readers might make sense spend much kindle paperwhite fine,3

5,"This is the best tablet for a kids tablet. The modified Android operating system with Amazon features built-in is great. I am reviewing for what it is, a KIDS TABLET. It has a 1.3 gigahertz processor, meaning for such a small device that decently enough. Internal memory is 8 gigs but you can expand to 256 gigabytes. You wont run out of memory.

5,"OK, I was so unsure of this Kindle because it does not have all of the bells and whistles of the others. BUT I am very happy with it. I love my Kindle! I have managed to read a book a week on it sicnce I got if for Christmas. I have been reading the free books on Kindle. There are so many to pick from. While home, I download the books that I want to read and then while I am in the car or waiting at the DMV, I just pull of the book and read. It remembers where I am in the book. This Kindle does not have the back light. I was nervous about that but so far this has not been a problem because the light it has is fine for me. When I am reading in the car, I enlarge the font and it makes seeing the words easier for me. That is the most important factor for me because I can get car sick if I read while riding in the car but with the larger font I don't have that problem. I wear glasses with bifocals and holding this seems to be more comfortable than a book because I can hold it up if I need to. The size is perfect! Again, I can enlarge the font so the smaller screen size really has nothing to do with the readability.

In the time it took me to do the research, Amazon had pushed out an update that fixed the Bluetooth problem the keyboard had been having. A lot of the one-star reviews are from people who bought the keyboard when this problem hadn't been solved yet.The keyboard itself has all the keys you'd expect: alphanumeric keys, up, down, left and right keys, and a few extra, like keys for the volume and a Home key that actually takes you to the carousel screen. However, there are a few curious omissions:1) No Page Up or Page Down2) No Delete key. (There's a Backspace key, but that's not the same thing.)The keys are well-spaced and it's not a problem touch typing on the keyboard. It's certainly not as spacious as a full-sized keyboard, but it's about the size of a keyboard on a smallish laptop.The one thing they could add that might make this keyboard close to perfect is a way to carry it.

I didn't realize that Amazon has it's OWN browser SILK. Everything even your banking info goes through Amazon. Not sure I like that. Also, items don't automatically close out when you leave a page and I have to frequently hit the button on the bottom and close out multiple items. It might just be that I am not THAT computer savoy, though I do know how to navigate my way around. Sometimes the touch feature just seems to freeze and won't recognize that I am attempting 'touch'. Lastly, the on/off button is right where you hold the tablet on the side, so I am often 'accidently' shutting it down. Most annoying! Overall, I am happy with my purchase and for the price I like it.
